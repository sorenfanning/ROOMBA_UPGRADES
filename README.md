# ROOMBA_UPGRADES
# Roomba Personalities Suite  
**Give your Roomba a personality.**  
An open‑source creative coding project inspired by iRobot® products and the Roomba Open Interface (ROI).

---

## Overview
Roomba Personalities Suite is a fictional collection of small programming projects that connect to older Roomba models through the Open Interface.  
It lets you create “personalities” — sets of behaviors that control a Roomba’s actions, such as:
- Following people or pets  
- Performing sequences of moves or sounds  
- Reacting to sensors, sound, or light  

The goal is to encourage learning, creativity, and community among Roomba hobbyists and programmers.
