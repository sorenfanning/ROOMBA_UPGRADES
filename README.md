# ROOMBA_UPGRADES
# Roomba Personalities Suite  
**Give your Roomba a personality.**  
An open‑source creative coding project inspired by iRobot® products and the Roomba Open Interface (ROI).

---

## Overview
Roomba Personalities Suite is a fictional collection of small programming projects that connect to older Roomba models through the Open Interface.  
It lets you create “personalities” — sets of behaviors that control a Roomba’s actions, such as:
- Following people or pets  
- Performing sequences of moves or sounds  
- Reacting to sensors, sound, or light  

The goal is to encourage learning, creativity, and community among Roomba hobbyists and programmers.

## Features
- Control Roombas via serial or Bluetooth  
- Modular “personality” design  
- Optional simulation mode  
- Example behaviors and templates  
- Open community for sharing ideas  

---

## Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pyserial` – robot communication  
  - `numpy`, `opencv-python` – logic and vision  
  - `pygame` – optional interface / simulation  
  - (optional) ROS 2 support for advanced users  

All dependencies use permissive open‑source licenses (MIT/BSD/Apache).
